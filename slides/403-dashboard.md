# 403: How to Build a Dashboard

In the previous chapters, we've learnt how to use Grafana and Templating to build dashboards.

We could go away now and build any dashboard we like.

But what makes a good dashboard? Let's find out.

## What Makes a Good Dashboard?

- Simple

- Expresses meaning

- Reveals details as required

- Relevance

## Information Overload

We have limited cognitive processing capacity. [1]

We can only process one (maybe a few) thing at a time. [2]

Context switching expends mental energy. [3]

### The Antidote: Minimalism

- Your dashboard should provide relevant information in less than **5 seconds** (5-second rule) [1]

- Severely restrict what is included. (E.g. a car dashboard) [2]

- No more than 5-9 Visualisations [1]

- Do not add a graph or text simply because you can [3]

## Meaning

- **Place the most important information at the top left**

We always start reading at the top left. The most important information should be at the top.

(Think like a journalist. They put the most important content at the top, details at the bottom.)

- **Use styling to convey meaning**

Red means bad. Green means good.

Big and Bold is important.

Grey and small is less important.

Keep colours and styles simple. Too much style can complicate the data.

---

## Details

Always, **minimalism**.

- Use plots and graphics to reduce the number of dimensions in the data.

- Always focus on the **SLI**'s/**KPI**'s.

- Select the right plot for the data...

### How to Choose the Best Visualisation

- Comparison
  - Among Items
      - Column
      - Table with embedded plots
  - Over Time
      - Line/Column
- Distribution
  - 1D: Histogram
  - 2D: Scatter

---

- Composition
  - Over Time
      - Stacked column/area plot
  - Static
      - Pie chart
      - Waterfall
- Relationship
  - Scatter plot

## Relevance: Who Is This Dashboard For?

Your software has a use case. Your dashboards need one too!

- Design dashboards to a **use case**

Think about the audience. Do they understand the metrics you are presenting? Does it need to be
simplified?

You should not have to explain your dashboard.

- Dashboards are **specific** to an audience. Make sure you know who the audience is.

Lets look at some examples...
